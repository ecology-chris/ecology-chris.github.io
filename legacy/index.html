  I've been working in IT since I was in middle school. I spent
  a lot of time upgrading modems and eventually converting them to DSL networks
  from the repair shop out of my parents dining room up until the point I moved
  off to college in Atlanta, GA. <br> I came across a handful of
  opportunities  after I was hired by the Division of Information Technology at
  Southern Polytechnic State University in late 2002. I eventually ran into a 6
  month project through my side business and decided to make the jump into full
  time consulting. <br> I consulted around Atlanta for 2 years before picking up
  a full time gig at a .Net development shop. Since then I've learned a lot
  about the best way to code for both the business, the developers, the networking
  and data center teams, and most importantly the software's end user. <br> After
  attending Velocity San Francisco in 2013 I became a full fledged DevOps
  convert. It's about tools and culture outside of development and operations
  work. It's about measuring things and trying to get better every time we do
  something and making sure the 'better' we're striving for is the best thing for
  everyone involved. <br> I love what I do and enjoy any chance to hear what
  others in industry are up to in their shops. I don't have as much free time as
  I'd like these days but I'd still love to talk about how we can help each other
  if and when we should have the chance. <br> To learn more about my center of
  practice please visit <a href="http://www.ecology-computing.com">Ecology
